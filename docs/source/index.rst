Tiny Embedded Intelligence Layer
===================================

**Tiny Embedded Intelligence Layer** (TEIL) is a project that aims to provide solutions for implementing and deploying embedded intelligence solutions in Resource-Scarce Embedded Systems. The following work is the junction of multiple ideas, implementations, and solutions produced during the development of my Ph.D. Thesis, in the same area. Nevertheless, the time was short of developing and producing many solutions that came to mind while working on such a topic, and I decided to start this documentation page to help everyone notice and find perfect solutions for the problem they may be facing.
