Tiny Embedded Intelligence Layer
===================================

**Tiny Embedded Intelligence Layer** (TEIL) is a cutting-edge framework designed to efficiently deploy machine learning (ML) models on resource-scarce embedded systems, such as Arduino, ARM Cortex-M, and similar devices. Developed as part of my PhD thesis, TEIL aims to bridge the gap between advanced ML techniques and the limitations of embedded systems, enabling real-time intelligence in environments with constrained resources.

TEIL offers seamless compatibility with popular machine learning libraries, including Scikit-Learn, and goes a step further by transpiling ML models into optimized C code, ensuring that these models can run effectively on devices with limited memory and processing power. In addition to supporting machine learning models, TEIL also provides capabilities for real-time data analysis, verification of ML models during runtime, and reducing the need for constant cloud communication, making it a versatile solution for autonomous, edge-based intelligence. With TEIL, embedded systems can harness the power of machine learning while maintaining performance and efficiency.
